## 🌍 Overview

The **BlueChain ML Engine** is a **four-stage, modular machine learning pipeline** designed for **Measurement, Reporting & Verification (MRV)** of land restoration and carbon sequestration projects.

The system transforms **raw satellite imagery and on-ground environmental data** into **auditable carbon credits**, ensuring that every issued credit is backed by measurable, explainable, and verifiable data.

This repository focuses **only on the ML and scientific computation layer** and is designed to integrate seamlessly with:
- Web frontends
- Blockchain minting logic
- Government or ESG reporting systems
